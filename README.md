# Histopathologic-Cancer-Detection

The Histopathologic Cancer Detection competition on Kaggle is a binary
classification problem using images. The objective of the competition is to develop a
model that can accurately classify metastatic tissue in histopathologic scans of
lymph node sections and determine whether a given image contains cancer or not.
The models are assessed based on their accuracy and their ability to correctly
classify the images.
To solve this issue we developed two different and simple Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNN) as our baseline model, and did several experiments to add
variations to it such as batch normalization and adding dropout layers to the fully
connected layers of our CNN to try increase accuracy and performance.
