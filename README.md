# Histopathologic-Cancer-Detection

This research project focuses on detecting metastatic cancer tissue in histopathologic images of lymph node sections using deep learning. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was developed to classify whether a given histopathologic image contains cancerous tissue or not, achieving 98% classification accuracy.
